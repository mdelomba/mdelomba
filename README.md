### Current Programming Goals
- [ ] Complete the freeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum.
  - I want to learn more about full stack web development.
  - This is a free resource to practice that.
- [ ] Read through "The Rust Programming Language".
  - Rust seems like an exciting new language to learn.
  - I completed the Rustlings course and I'm looking to get more insight into the language.
- [ ] Read through "A Manager's Path".
  - I want to be an effective leader and I'll take all the help I can get to achieve that.
  - I'm hoping to get some good nuggets of information from this book on the subject.
- [ ] Create the following:
  - [ ] A website that displays Pokemon TCG cards and information about them.
    - I've been playing Pokemon video games since I was a kid and think this would be a fun project to tackle.
  - [ ] A website that uses a weather api to display a forecast for the area.
  - [ ] An app using Rust for messaging.
    - I'm less concerned about the messaging itself and more about transferring packets.
    - This is mainly to learn and practice sending data using TCP.
